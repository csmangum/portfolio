# MugFakes
This is an ongoing project

# Overview
The purpose of this project was to first find a novel data source and then work to generate realistic fake mugshots folowwing some of the major advancments in Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) over the past few years. I first needed to find real mugshot images online. There are some websites where you can purchase access to mugshots but I wanted to gather the images myself to have more control over the quality and type. To accomplish this I created several web scrapers that pulled mugshots from local govermnet websites where public access to mugshots are legal.

# Approach
1. GANs
2. StyleGAN
3. StyleGAN2
4. Interactive MugFake model

## First Run | GAN | 32x32
