# Portfolio for Chris Mangum

The goal of this repository is to store all my working projects, scripts I develop, and other Data Science related topics

## Full Scale Projects: 
  - [California Housing Market](https://github.com/csmangum/portfolio/blob/master/Projects/Home_Value_Prediction/California_Housing_Market.ipynb): Predict housing prices in California (Supervised Regression).
  - [Predicting Employee Retention](https://github.com/csmangum/portfolio/blob/master/Projects/Employee_Satisfaction/Employee_Satisfaction.ipynb): Determine why employees are leaving (Supervised Classification).
  - [Airbnb Price Prediction](https://github.com/csmangum/portfolio/tree/master/Airbnb%20Price%20Prediction): Large-scale project looking to identify the factors that most impact profit growth (Updated May 2019).
