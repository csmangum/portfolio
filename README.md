# Portfolio for Chris Mangum

The goal of this repository is to store all my working projects, scripts I develop, and other Data Science related topics

## Full Scale Projects: 
  - [Airbnb Price Prediction](https://github.com/csmangum/portfolio/tree/master/Airbnb%20Price%20Prediction): 
    - Large-scale project looking to predict listing price.
    - Includes detailed exploratory notebook and data cleaning.
    - Utilized feature selection techniques including variance threshold and Step-Forward selection.
    - Culminating on an optimized Gradient Boosted regressor model.
  - [California Housing Market](https://github.com/csmangum/portfolio/blob/master/Projects/Home_Value_Prediction/California_Housing_Market.ipynb): 
    - Predict housing prices in California.
  - [Predicting Employee Retention](https://github.com/csmangum/portfolio/blob/master/Projects/Employee_Satisfaction/Employee_Satisfaction.ipynb): 
    - Determine why employees are leaving.
