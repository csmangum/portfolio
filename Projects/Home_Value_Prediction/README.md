# California Housing Market
***
## Purpose:
Real dataset based on California housing details. I will try new techniques I haven't used before and better understand how models will perform based on these new techniques and parameters.


### *Primary Question*

*Can we predict housing prices with supplied data?*


### *Fields in the dataset include:*

* Longitude             
* Latitude             
* Housing median age    
* Total rooms           
* Total bedrooms     
* Population          
* Households         
* Median income        
* Median house value **(Target Variable)**
* Ocean proximity 


## Findings:
* Decision Tree performed poorly
* Linear Regression performed slighlty better
* Random Forrests performed better of the three
* Selected and performed fine-tuning on the Random Forests Model
* Final MSE on the test set of 47766

## Outline:
1. Initial Investigation
2. Create Train and Test Sets
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Model Preperation
5. Evaluate Models
6. Fine-Tune Model
